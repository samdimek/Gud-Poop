Creating a bot to bid automatically on assignments on a site like Studybay involves several steps, including web scraping, interacting with the website, and handling login/authentication. 

Below is a basic outline of how you can approach this project in Python using libraries like selenium for browser automation and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.

## Prerequisites
* Python installed on your machine.
* Seleninum library installed, use `pip install selenium`
* BeautifulSoup library installed, use `pip install beautifulsoup4`
* WebDriver for your browser, eg. ChromeDriver for Google chrome.

### WebDriver

This project will be using ChromeDriver, a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome.

Managed to download the chromeDriver and set its path to a system path.
